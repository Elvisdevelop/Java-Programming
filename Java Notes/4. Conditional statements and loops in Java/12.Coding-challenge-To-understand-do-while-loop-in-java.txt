write a do while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers.
The numbers should be added and the sum displayed.
After adding and printing, the loop should ask whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again.
if so, the loop should repeat; Otherwise it should terminate.

sample input -> 5 and 10;
sample output -> 15

sample input 1 -> 10 and 20;
sample output 1 -> 30

Solution:

public class AddTwoNumbers{
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int input = 0;  
        do {
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Please Enter The First Number: ");
            int num1 = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println("Please Enter The second Number: ");
            int num1 = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
            System.out.println("Enter 1 to Continue, to exit, enter anything else");
            input = sc.nextInt();
        } while (input == 1);
    }
}
