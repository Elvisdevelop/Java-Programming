Facts about do while loop in java

Curly braces are optional and without curly braces we can only take one statement between do and while which should not be declarative statements
Example :

do
    System.out.println("Hello);
while(true);

Let’s see whether the following statements are valid or invalid?

Example 1
do{
    System.out.println("Hello");
}while(true);
System.out.println("Hi");

Compile time error : Unreachable statement
Reason : Since System.out.println(“Hi”); is not reachable

Example 2

int a = 10, b = 20;
do{
    System.out.println("Hello");
}while(a<b);
System.out.println("Hi");
This is a valid program
Output → 
Hello
Hi

Example 3

int a = 10, b = 20;
do{
    System.out.println("Hello");
}while(a>b);
System.out.println("Hi");
This is valid java program
Output →
Hello
Hello
(infinite times)

Example 4
final int a = 10, b = 20;
do{
    System.out.println("Hello");
}while(a<b);
System.out.println("Hi");

Compile time error : Unreachable statement
Reason : Since sop(“Hi”); is not reachable

Example 5
final int a = 10, b = 20;
do{
    System.out.println("Hello");
}while(a>b);
System.out.println("Hi");
This is a valid program
Output →
Hello
Hi
do
System.out.println(“Hello”);

Example 6
while(true);
This is a valid program
Curly braces are optional however if curly braces are not used, do while can then have one statement at most.

Example 7
do;
while(true);
This is a valid java program

Example 8
do
int x = 10;
while(true);
This is not a valid java program
Within do while can have only statements at most without curly braces, it
should not be a declarative statement. Since having declarative statements
does not make sense as it cannot be accessed outside of do while loop
and within do while loop there are no statements.

Example 9

do{
    int x = 10;
} while(true);

This is a valid java program
If you are using curly braces compiler will allow only declarative
statements. Since you can add more statements since curly braces are
used.

Example 10
do
while(true);

This program is invalid
Do-while not having any statements is not valid. Since do while is used to
do repetitive tasks and having do while without statements does not make
sense.
