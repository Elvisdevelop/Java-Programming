write a java to accept integer from user and print the factorial of the number using while loop.

What is a factorial number?
is the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

Example:
Factorial of 5 (5!) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
Factorial of 10 (10!) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320

sample Input -> 5
sample Output -> 120

sample Input 1 -> 10
sample Output -> 40320

Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Factorial {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("Enter the number whise Factorial is to be calculated: ");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int factorial = 1;
        int i = 1;

        while(i >= a){
            factorial = factorial + 1;
            i++;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial for " + a + " is: " + factorial);
        
    }
}
