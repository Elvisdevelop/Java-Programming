Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    //statements that will execute
}

Initialization : For loop starts with executing this part, where in variable or
counter is initialized

Condition : Once the variable or counter is initialized the condition is
evaluated. If the condition is true then statements in the loop is executed.

executed, where in value for variable or counter is either incremented or
decremented.

Infinite loop syntax

for(;;){
    //statements to be executed
}

Infinite loop runs infinitely and does not do any termination or condition
checks. 
Program has to be terminated abnormally to stop infinite loop.
