Break statement in java

Java offers a break statement which is used to exit a loop. Whenever break
is encountered, remaining statements in the loop are terminated.

Syntax :

break;

Example:

for (int i = 0 ; i <= 10; i++){
    if (i == 5){
        break;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
System.out.println("Outside The For Loop");
