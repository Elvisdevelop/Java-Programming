Continue statement in Java

Continue statement is used to make the program jump to the next iteration
of the loop. Whenever continue statement is executed the rest of the
statements in the loop are skipped and control goes back to evaluate the
condition and execute the next iteration.

Syntax :
continue

Example:

for (int i = 0 ; i <= 10; i++){
    if (i == 5){
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
