getting executed. Next case statement is executed till a break is
encountered or the switch statement is terminated. This is known as the
fallthrough inside switch statement.

to fallthrough inside switch statement in java

● When the variable being used in switch statement is equal to a case,
the statements following that case will execute until a break
statement is reached.

● When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the
flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.

● Break is optional and not every case needs to contain a break. If no
break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent
cases until a break is reached.
