Facts about if...else statement in java

Lets understand how if...else will behave in certain scenarios with the help of some examples

Example 1

int x = 0;

if(x){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("Hello java");
}

Above is not a valid program and we will get a compile time error. 
Since the condition in the if….else statement should always be boolean.

Example 2

int x = 10;

if(x = 20){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("Hello java");
}

Here we are not using a comparison operator but we are using an assignment operator. 
After assignment x value is 20. if(20) is a compile time error since it's not boolean. 
Hence we will get a compile time error above.

Example 3

int x = 10;

if(x == 20){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("Hello java");
}

Here we will get “Hello java” as output since 10 is not equal to 20. 
We are using a comparison operator here, hence the output of the expression is boolean.

Example 4

boolean b = true;

if(b = false){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("Hello java");
}

Since we are using the assignment operator, so b will become false while executing the if statement. 
Hence for if(false) the output will be “Hi”

Example 5

boolean b = false;

if(b == false){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("Hello java");
}

Since, here we are using comparison operator the output of the expression in the condition will be “true” and “Hello world” would be printed.
