Conditional Operator OR Ternary Operator

Operators in java can be classified into 3 types depending on the number of operands they operate on:-

● Unary operators : are the operators which take only 1 operand. Example : ++, --
● Binary operators : are the operators which take 2 operands. Example +, -, /
● Ternary operators : are the operators which take 3 operands. There is only 1 ternary operator in java which is also known as the conditional operator.

Ternary operator or conditional operator
The combination of “?” and “:” is called ternary operator

Syntax :
boolean-expression ? true-expression : false-expression

If the boolean expression above is evaluated to true then true expression is evaluated. If boolean expression is evaluated to false then false expression is evaluated.

Example of a ternary operator in use :
Let’s use ternary operator to find out greater of two numbers

int a = 10, b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
System.out.println("Value of max : " + max);

Ternary operators can also be nested.
Example :

int max = (10 > 20) ? 40 : ((50 > 60) ? 90 : 100);
Output → 100
