What are identifiers in java?
We have an identifier for everything in the real world around us. 
If you look around you can see your phone, table, pen, etc. 
Everything around us hasa name. 
These names are nothing but identifiers for objects around us.
These identifiers around us help us identify those things and communicate better. 
Similarly in java, we have identifiers that are names given to method name, variable name, class name
Example :

class ABC{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int x = 10;
    }
}

There are 5 identifiers in this program above
a. Class name - ABC
b. Method name - main()
c. Predefined class name : String[]
d. Argument name : args
e. Integer : x

Rules for naming identifiers
1. The only allowed characters in java identifiers are a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $, _
2. We canâ€™t use reserved words as identifiers
3. All predefined java class names and interface names can be used as identifiers
4. Identifiers cannot start with a digit. Total123 is valid, but 123total is invalid and we will get a compile time error.
5. Java identifiers are case sensitive since java language is case sensitive programming language
6. There is no length limit for java identifiers, but it is not recommended to take too lengthy identifiers.
