Understanding byte, short, int, long
What are data types?

Variables are nothing but containers that holds value for you in the memory
during the course of execution of the program. 
But how much memory to allocate is decided by data type. 
Datatype for a variable tell java what type of values we are going to store in that variable.
Java has predefined primitive data types which is used to store 4
categories of values
● Integer
● Floating point numbers
● Characters
● Boolean
To store Integers we have 4 primitive data types
Byte, short, int, long

Floating point numbers
Double, float

Character values
Char

Boolean values
Boolean datatype

Datatype    Size of value it can store  Range it can store
byte        8 bits or 1 byte            -128 to 127
short       16 bits or 2 bytes          -32_768 to 32_767
int         32 bits or 4 bytes          -2_147_483_648 to 2_147_483_647
long        64 bits or 8 bytes          -9223372036854775808L to 9223372036854775807L

Enhancing readability

Java allows usage of underscores (_) to enhance readability of large
numbers. 
Like in normal english you enhance the readability of numbers by using comma (,) like 100,000. 
Similarly, in java

int i = 100_000;
This is a valid statement and allowed in java.

You can place underscores only between digits; you cannot place
underscores in the following places:
● At the beginning or end of a number
● Adjacent to a decimal point in a floating point literal
● Prior to an F or L suffix
● In positions where a string of digits is expected
