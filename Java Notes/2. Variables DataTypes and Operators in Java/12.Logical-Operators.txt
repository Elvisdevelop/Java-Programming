Logical Operators in Java

There are 3 kinds of logical operators in java

&& (and operator) : this operator returns true if both operands are true.

|| (or operator) : this operator returns true if any of the operands are true.

! (not operator) : this operator works with only one operand and reverses the boolean value.
