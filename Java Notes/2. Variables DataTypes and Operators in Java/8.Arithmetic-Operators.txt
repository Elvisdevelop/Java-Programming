Arithmetic Operators in Java

Types of operators
● Arithmetic operators
+ - * / % ++ --

● Relational operators
== != > < >= <=

● Logical operators
&& || !

● Assignment operators
= += -= *= /= %=

● Conditional operators
?:

All operators perform operations on operands. For example, if we are performing addition operation like (a + b), here a and b are operands and + is the operator.   
Arithmetic operators
● Addition (+) : used to perform addition on two operands
● Subtraction (-) : used to perform subtraction on two
operands
● Multiplication (*) : used to perform multiplication on two
operands
● Division (/) : used to perform multiplication on two operands
● Modulus (%) : prints the remainder of the operation after
performing division
● Increment (++) : increments the value by 1.
● Decrement (--) : decrements the value by 1
