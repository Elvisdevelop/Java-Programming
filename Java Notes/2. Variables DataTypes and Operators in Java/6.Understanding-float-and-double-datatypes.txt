Understanding float and double data type

Float and double are the datatypes that can be used to store numbers with decimal values.

Representing float and double
● They can be represented by using f or F. Example float a = 1.23f or float b = 1.23F
● Double can be represented by using d or D. Example double a = 1.23d or double b = 1.23D
● By default numbers with decimal values are considered as double, if you want to assign to float you have to explicitly mention that.

Precision values
● Float preserves decimal values upto 7 precision values
● Double preserves decimal values upto 16 precision values
● Double is used in program where you need value with higher precision
