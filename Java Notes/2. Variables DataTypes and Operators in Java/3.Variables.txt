Variables in Java

What are variables?

Variables are nothing but containers that holds value for you in the memory during the course of execution of the program.

Variable creation is a two step process :
1. Declaration
2. Variable initialization

Variable creation process

1st way :
Step 1 : Declare the variable
int firstVariable;
Step 2 : Initialize the variable
firstVariable = 10;

2nd way :
Declaration and initialization combined
int firstVariable = 10;
Always keep in mind - variable names have to be unique.

What happens when declaration and initialization statements are executed by java?
Whenever you declare a variable, java creates a memory block and to store the value of the declared type and when you assign a value to it, that value sits in the memory block just assigned
