Types of assignment statements in java

There are 3 type of assignment statements in java
1. Simple assignment
2. Chained assignment
3. Compound assignment

Lets understand each one of them.

1. Simple assignment
int x = 10;
This is an example of simple assignment where in value on right is assigned to variable on left
int y = x;

We can also have variable on the right side, so the value of variable on right hand side, sits in the variable on left hand side.

2. Chained assignment
Chained assignment is done to assign single value to multiple variables at one

Example :
int a, b, c, d;
a = b = c = d = 200;
System.out.println(a + "..." + b + "..." + c + "..." + d);
Output → 200 … 200 … 200 … 200

When using chained assignment keep in mind, you cannot perform chained assignment during declaration
int a = b = c = d = 200;
Above is not a valid code

3. Compound assignment
Whenever we use assignment operator with some other operator to initialize value it is called compound assignment

class ABC{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int a = 30;
        a += 20;
        System.out.println("Value of a : " + a);
    }
}
Output → 50

Point to remember about compound assignments

Whenever you use compound assignments, implicit type casting is automatically performed

Scenario 1 :

class ABC{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        byte b = 10;
        b=b+1;
        System.out.println("Value of b : " + b);
    }
}
You will get a compile time error on executing above code.

Scenario 2 :

class ABC{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        byte b = 10;
        b += 30
        System.out.println("Value of b : " + b);
    }
}
Output → 40

In case of compound assignment operators, typecasting will be performed automatically.
So, b += 30 is equivalent to b = (type of b)(b + 30);
