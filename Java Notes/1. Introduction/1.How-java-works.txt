How Java Works (Computers only understand low-level languages)
Java is High level Programming Language, But the statements in java are somewhat english-like.
This is because we as humans can read and understand the source code.

COMPILATION
-> Process of converting source code from higher level form to machine level form which computers or machine can understand. and its easy for them to execute.
COMPILER
-> is an intermidiater which translates the source code from higher level form to machine level form which computers or machine can understand.
