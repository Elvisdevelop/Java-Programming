What are methods in java?

Collection of java statements that are designed to perform an operation.
Example of methods : method to find the largest of the 3 numbers, method to add 2 numbers in java. Java has predefined methods : println(), main() method
By calling println() and passing a string you tell java to print that information on screen. 
Java has this method somewhere, where it takes care of the steps required to print information on the screen. 
Programmer using this method doesnâ€™t have to worry about the underlying operations

Syntax :

modifier return-type method-name(<parameter-list>){
//statements;
}

modifier : sets the access level for this method and defines from where this method can be accessed

return-type : defines the return type of the method

method-name : the name of the method using which it can be identified

parameters-list : list of parameters which the method accepts

Calling a method

method-name(<parameters-list);

Benefits of methods

Code reusability : promotes code reusability. Since method can be defined once and used at multiple places reducing the code redundancy.

Code readability : Method makes code more readable and easy to understand. 
addTwoNumbers() tells exactly what operation this method will perform.
