Returning value from method

You can return a value from a method after performing a certain operation.

Syntax

modifier return-type method-name(<parameter-list>){
//statements;
}

return-type : here defines the data type of the return value which the method is supposed to have

Java offers a return keyword to return a value from within the method

Syntax :

return <value>;

Few things to keep in mind about return statement

● One method can have multiple return statement
● If the method declaration has a return-type other than void, the method should have a return statement. Else compiler will throw an error.
