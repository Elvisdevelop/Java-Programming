    //What are packages?
    //Packages are collection of classes that are related, interfaces and other packages.
    //Always remember
    //It is not recommended in java to have multiple classes in a single java file
    //Since it would affect readability and is not good programming


    //For example , if I want to create 500 classes in java for a project and if I declare all my classes in a single file, imagine
    //the length of the file and the clutter it will have

    //It would be very difficult for a programmer to navigate through the file and make appropriate changes
    //If you are working in a team of programmers where multiple engineers are working on the same project, it would make it even difficult to collaborate.
    // Hence, it is always recommended to declare multiple classes in multiple files

    //This approach makes it easier to find relevant code and helps improve
    //readability and maintainability.

    //There are two types of packages

    //User_defined packages : User defined packages which are created and defined by the user
    //For example, you are working on software for a loan providing company, you could create packages to group similar classes.
    //Like you can create a packages for storing home loan classes, a different package for car loan, etc


    //System defined packages - these are packages which are built in a system with ready-made classes. These packages come along with JDK
    //to simplify the task of programmers.Some of the commonly used built-in packages are java.lang, java.io, java.util, java.applet,etc. For example , the scanner class
    //which you use to read
